Shared Subgraphs 
================

As the toolbox for Deep Learning (DL) developers becomes more powerful and 
better able to target workloads with both local and remote data, it becomes 
increasingly important to be able to work in collaborative spaces like 
subgraphs.  

Intel nGraph Library is designed to allow the framework considerable leverage in 
what optimizations can be done either for :abbr:`Ahead of Time (AoT)` compilation 
scenarios, or for :abbr:`Just in Time (JiT)` execution of training workloads.  

Indeed, DL models that support :glossary:`backpropagation` have a unique 
opportunity to work in a shared "space" or through a custom API that is 
compatible with nGraph ops.
